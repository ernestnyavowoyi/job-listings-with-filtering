# Job listings with filtering

This project allows users to filter job ads by the categories they choose.
Role, Level, Languages, and Tools are the four categories. Several filters can be applied, and the user is shown jobs that meet the provided filters.

The project is designed to be fully responsive and works on both mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px)+ devices.

Thank you so much for your time and consideration.
